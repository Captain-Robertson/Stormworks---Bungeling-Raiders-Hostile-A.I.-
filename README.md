This is the script and individual ship xml files used in the Stormworks addon that I've posted on the Steam Workshop, the script itself is essentially just a modified version of the default AI script but it was enough of a stepping-stone for an unskilled hobbyist like myself to get this project off the ground. I've uploaded it here so that anyone that's actually good at coding (unlike me) can take a look at it and potentially contribute any improvements to the overall project.

As always, the top contributors will most definitely have their names mentioned in the credits and if they have a steam account I will offer to add them as co-creators.

Many thanks!
