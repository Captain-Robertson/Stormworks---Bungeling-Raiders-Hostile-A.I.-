This is the script file used in the Bungeling Raiders addon for Stormworks that I've posted on the Steam Workshop, the script itself began as just a modified version of the default AI script with a handful of ships that shot back at the player but it was enough of a stepping-stone for an unskilled hobbyist like myself to get this project off the ground. 

Thankfully I've been joined in this project by the very talented Haiwei, who's ability to code puts my amateurish efforts to shame and has helped this addon improve significantly since its inception back in September 2024.

As always this will remain open to the public, so if anyone else wants to help contribute towards it over the next few years - whether it be bug fixes or enhancements - then please don't hesitate to get in touch, as the top contributors will most definitely have their names mentioned in the credits and if they have a steam account I may even offer to add them as co-creators if their contribution is signifcant enough.

Many thanks!
